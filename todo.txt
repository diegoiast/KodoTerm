1. Visual & UX Enhancements
   1.1. Theming Support: Implement a system to switch between color schemes (e.g., Solarized, Monokai, Nord). (DONE: Loaders for Konsole and Windows Terminal implemented)
   1.2. Dynamic Font Zooming: Add handlers for Ctrl + +, Ctrl + -, and Ctrl + 0 to adjust font size on the fly.(Initial implementation done)
   1.3. Alternative Screen Buffer Logic: Automatically hide/disable scrollbar in apps like vim/htop. (Initial implementation done)
   1.4. Cursor Customization: Support different cursor shapes (Block, Underline, Bar) and blinking. (Initial implementation done)

2. Interactive Features
   2.1. URL Detection: Scan text for URLs and make them clickable (Ctrl + Click).
   2.2. Search Functionality: A search bar (Ctrl+F) to find text in visible area and scrollback.
   2.3. Right-Click Context Menu: Menu with Copy, Paste, Select All, Clear Scrollback, and Reset Terminal. (Initial implementation done)

3. Advanced Terminal Capabilities
   3.1. OSC Sequence Support: Handle escape sequences for window title, CWD, and dynamic colors. (DONE)
   3.2. Graphics (Sixel) Support: Implement rendering for Sixel graphics via libvterm.
   3.3. Text Reflow: Adjust text in scrollback buffer when the window is resized horizontally.

4. Integration & Management
   4.1. Session Logging: Option to record input and output to a text file. (DONE)
   4.2. Working Directory Tracking: Monitor PTY's CWD for "Open File Browser" or "New Tab" features. (monitor is done, opening dir in file browser is broken).
   4.3. Bell Support: Visual or audible alerts for the \a (bell) character. (DONE)

5. Windows 
   5.1 On closing the widget, a process is still running. This needs to be closed. [fixed]
   
   
Optimizations:
  Area & Update Reductions
   1. Damage Tracking: Uses libvterm's damage reports to only process the specific rectangle that changed, rather than scanning the whole screen.
      [wip]
   2. Render Throttling: (The "Timer" trick) Decouples data arrival from drawing to limit updates to ~60 FPS, preventing UI lockup.
   3. Localized Invalidation: Updates only the small cursor rectangle during blinks instead of repainting the entire widget.
      [wip]
   4. Row & Column Clipping: Strictly limits inner rendering loops to the horizontal and vertical bounds of the damaged area.
      [wip]

  Drawing Logic Optimizations
   5. Differential Rendering (Shadow Buffer): Maintains a copy of the last frame and performs a cell-by-cell comparison to skip drawing identical cells.
   6. Backbuffer Architecture: Draws everything to an off-screen QImage, making the final paintEvent a near-instant bit-blit.
      [wip]
   7. Batch Rendering (Run-Length): Groups consecutive characters with the same colors into a single "run" to minimize drawText calls.
   8. Whitespace Culling: Detects and skips the expensive drawText operation for runs of space characters on the default background.

  Data & Resource Caching
   9. Color Caching (Indexed & TrueColor): Caches resolved QColor objects (including an MRU cache for RGB colors) to eliminate thousands of allocations per second.
      [done] - 0%
   10. Selection Pre-calculation: Normalizes selection ranges once per frame so the inner loop uses simple integer comparisons instead of complex logic.

  Qt & OS Level Tweaks
   11. Opaque Paint Attributes: Enables Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent to stop the OS/Qt from wasting time erasing the widget background before we draw.
      [wip]
   12. Disabled Text Antialiasing: Forces raw font rendering for maximum speed, which is significantly faster than smoothed text.

  I am ready for the reset. Let me know when you've reverted the code and which number you want to start with!
