# KodoTerm

A free C++ Qt6 widget that embeds a terminal emulator using `libvterm`.

## Features

- **Simple Qt6 integration**: Derives `QWidget`, and contains somewhat
   compatibility with `QProcess`.
- **LibVTerm**: Uses the robust `libvterm` for VT100/xterm emulation.
- **PTY Support**: Handles pseudo-terminal on Windows and Unix.
- **Themes**: supports themes from Konsole and WindowsTerminal.

## Prerequisites

- C++20 compiler
- CMake 3.24+
- Qt6 (Core, Gui, Widgets)

> The reason is that the communication between the console background process
> and the main application uses similar channels. This is a limitation of

## Known issues

1. It is rather slow. Specially on windows, painting takes too much time.
2. The demo has an option to re-display the main window with shortcuts, this
   is not working on Wayland.
3. It seems that `libvterm` is no longer maintained. Alternatives should be used
   eventually.
4. See [`todo.txt`](todo.txt) some tasks are not done yet.
